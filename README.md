Booknshelf is your online bookshelf that helps you to stay organized with your books.

More specifically you can use Booknshelf to:

- search for books or discover new ones from curated topics
- easily organize your books in online shelves
- connect with friends and other readers to see what they are reading
- follow different topics and like books

However, this is just the beginning! I've talked about the long term goal of this project in [my post](https://medium/@tik).

Get started using booknshelf on the [booknshelf.com website](https://booknshelf.com).
