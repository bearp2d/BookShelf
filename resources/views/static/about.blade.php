                            Booknshelf is a website where you can keep track of all your books online. You can easily organize your books in different shelves and never forget about any book you have read or want to read. You can also use  booknshelf to discover new books from our curated topics and see what your friends are reading.

                            I have only one and simple goal, to make Booknshelf the best place to keep track of all your books online.
                            I love staying organized with my books and I'm sure there are people like me who love that too.

                            Booknshelf does not make money at this point. My eventual goal is to work on Booknshelf
                            full-time. Yes, full-time üëå. However, this is still something I'm exploring. I'll probably
                            start with <a class="about-link" target="_blank"
                                          href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/">Amazon

                                Program</a> and then go from there. My first financial goal is
                            to make Booknshelf a self-sustainable side-project.
                            People say setting goals are very important. Here we go, I have it now üòÅ.

                            fan so all the backend is built on Laravel. Laravel is a PHP framework. I
