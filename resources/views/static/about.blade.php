                            Booknshelf is a place to discover great books and bookshelves and share them with your
                            friends. People come to Booknshelf to find their next read, see what their friends are
                            reading and build their reading journey along the way. It's also a place where you can keep
                            track of your books and stay organized.

                            To be honest, I don't exactly know what's the long term goal of Booknshelf. However, I'm
                            sure I want it to be a community hub of book enthusiasts, learners, and readers. Some
                            people may come to Booknshelf to find their next read and some find great resources to
                            learn about different topics. I'm working super hard to take Booknshelf to that point!

                           style="font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif; line-height: 150%; font-size: 19px;">
                            Booknshelf does not make money at this point. My eventual goal is to work on Booknshelf
                            full-time. Yes, full-time üëå. However, this is still something I'm exploring. I'll probably
                            start with <a class="about-link" target="_blank"
                                          href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/">Amazon

                                Program</a> and then go from there. My first financial goal is
                            to make Booknshelf a self-sustainable side-project and I'm very inspired by <a
                                class="about-link" target="_blank"

                            fan so all the backend is built on Laravel. Laravel is a PHP framework. I
                            also love <a

                            and its amazing community so the entire front-end is powered by Vue.js. I also can't say
                            enough
                            good words about <a
