- When looking at other shelf books you should be able to save it to your bookshelf if you want.
    - When youâ€™re not logged in you should see a login popup instead of your bookshelves
    - Login and then you can save it.
- Default cover for bookshelves
- I think for the first version let's show only our picked bookshelves.
- Change the font, make it pretty.
