- Create pre-push hook for codecept, push success only if all tests pass.
- How to achieve smooth loading in booksnelf? do not show the tags etc
    - Oh awesome see how Spark uses loading var to make sure we display the data only when it's available,
    like profile.js file and blade for setting panel.
    - Use this approach everywhere, even when diplaying the shelves.
    - why is spark loading so smooth but booknshelf not???
- Wrtie more tests and do some clean up in frontend and backend.
