# Booknshelf
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/tiggreen/booknshelf.svg?token=5yTUaMZbo4c2WU4m6zsD&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/tiggreen/booknshelf)

Programming is hard. With practice it gets easier.

Exercism gives you hundreds of practice problems in over 30 programming languages,
and a place where you can get feedback on your solutions.

Exercism is especially well-suited for three types of practice:

- gaining fluency in your first programming language
- ramping up in a new programming language
- developing the skills to be a great lead developer: code review, refactoring, and mentoring

## Using Booknshelf

The process happens in two places.

0. Solve exercises in your local development environment.
0. Discuss solutions on the [Exercism website](http://exercism.io).

Once you submit the solution to an exercise you can:

- **learn by listening**: receive feedback on your code.
- **learn by reading code**: browse all the other solutions to exercises you submitted solutions to.
- **learn by sharing your experience**: provide feedback on other people's code.

Even in the most trivial exercise, there are many important things to discuss. Simplicity, naming,
readability, idioms, good use of existing libraries, performance, and much, much more.

Get started using booknshelf on the [booknshelf.com website](https://booknshelf.com).
