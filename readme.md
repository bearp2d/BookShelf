[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/tiggreen/booknshelf.svg?token=5yTUaMZbo4c2WU4m6zsD&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/tiggreen/booknshelf)

We are getting busier which means that reading or finishing books is getting harder.

Booknshelf helps you to read more books by making you more organized in your reading journey.

More specifically you can use Booknshelf to:

- search for books or discover new ones from curated topics
- easily organize your current and past books in online shelves
- connect with friends and other readers to see what they are reading

However, this is just the beginning! Read more about the long term goal here [my post](https://medium/@tik).

Get started using booknshelf on the [booknshelf.com website](https://booknshelf.com).
