## Submitting Code Changes

These instructions should get you closer to getting a commit into the
repository.

See the [Setting up Local Development guide][local-dev-env] for more information about how to run booknshelf.com locally.

### Git Workflow

1. Fork and clone.
1. Add the upstream booknshelf.com repository as a new remote to your clone.
   `git remote add upstream https://github.com/booknshelf/booknshelf.com.git`
1. Create a new branch
   `git checkout -b name-of-you-branch`
1. Commit and push as usual on your branch.
1. When you're ready to submit a pull request, rebase your branch onto
   the upstream master so that you can resolve any conflicts:
   `git fetch upstream && git rebase upstream/master`
   You may need to push with `--force` up to your branch after resolving conflicts.
1. When you've got everything solved, push up to your branch and send the pull request as usual.

### Issues

We keep track of bugs, enhancements and support requests in the repository using GitHub [issues][].
